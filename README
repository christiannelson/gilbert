This is a very simple experiment to see what it would be like to use juggernaut
for real-time updates to comments on articles.  It's contrived, but that's ok,
it's an experiment afterall.

= Requirements
* ruby 1.9.2
* bundler 1.0+
* mysql 5.0+
* redis 2.0+
* node.js 0.2.4+

= Do it now

Make sure you have all of the git submodules in place:
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

First time setup:
$ rake db:create db:reset

Start the websockets evented server:
$ cd juggernaut && node server.js

Start the rails application:
$ unicorn -p 3000

Check out the applicaiton:
Open http://localhost:3000/articles/1 in multiple browsers and start adding comments.
